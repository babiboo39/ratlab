            Tou our dearest customer,<br><br>
            On the last march, our technical analyst discoverd an attack that occured our system, and causing the collapse of our website,
            they also said there is the possibility of the customer's information leaked publicly.
            I don't know exactly how the hacker did this. Our technical folks are telling me something about injection and clam shell? I'm not sure about all of that.<br><br>
            To prove our commitment, I fired all of our existing technical staff, because they have failed already.
            We are going to restart from the inception and no more excuses! Our tech guys will make due with what they've got.<br><br>
            You gotta see the face of our new guys! They're the type of the real tech hipsters, so that the security won't be a problem now.<br><br>
            Your true friend,<br><br>
            <br>Reynold Bartholomew
