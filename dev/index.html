    <p>
        If you're reading this, you're likely a contractor that working for RatOnLab Gallery. Congratulations and Welcome!
        I'm the team leader, Edward Allen. The CEO has literally fired the previous tech team. As a result, we need to hire a bunch of tech people as quick as possible.
        This is the crash course on RatOnLab Gallery's website.
        <br>
        <h3>How did the previous website get attacked?</h3>
        <p>
            Based on the previous Technical Analyst's report, the attack is occurred because of the Injection vulnerability on the website.
            From there they exploited the Injection vulnerability to dump our customer's data. They also add that the attacker use upload function
            to upload their shell, and exploit it to get the shell on the box. Not only the customer's data is leaked, they also take over the entire system and crushing all of the website's artifacts.
            We haven't had a chance to make sure there were no lingering traces of the hack, so if you find any, send me an email.
            <br> 
        </p>
        <h3>How are we preventing future breaches?</h3>
        <p>
            As request of Mr.Bartholomew, we are changing all the previous artifact and change it to the new one,
            in order to prevent the previous attack occurred one more time. We also have been tasked to do specific improve in the system.
            <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Design of new system?</h3>
        <p>
            The new website will still be written in PHP, with MariaDB as the database.
            Also be aware when implementing the new website, since PHP have some vulnerable function,
            try to avoid it. Another information,firstly you will implement the website from the admin side.

            <!-- since you're using the admin side to develop you can use this credential -->
            <!-- username : admin
            password : 2034f6e32958647fdff75d265b455ebf -->
            <!-- We'll remove this on prod, It's not like a hacker can do anything with a hash -->
