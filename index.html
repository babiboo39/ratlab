        <p>Thank you for visiting RatOnLab's website, where you can look at the art collection and also buy it.
        But unfortunately, now we are suspending our business operations until further notice, because of the attack that occurred by a hacker to our system.
        We are now figuring out about the attack and the possibility of our customer's data leaked to public.
